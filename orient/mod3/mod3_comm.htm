<h1 id="top">Communicating Effectively Online</h1>

<p>In the online classroom, most communication takes place through writing. What does this mean to online students?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Written communications can enable you to get to know your instructor and classmates on a deep, rather 
  than just a superficial, level. Communicating through the written 
  word enables you to think through your ideas thoroughly before presenting them. 
  And, you can take the time to make sure your words express exactly what 
  you want to say.</li>
	<li> If your writing abilities are limited, you may need to take some additional writing classes before or as part of your online learning experience.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#bboards">Discussion boards</a>, <a href="#email">email</a>, and <a href="#chat">chat</a> make online classes a truly interactive way to learn - often more interactive than participating in a traditional class.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"></a></p>

<hr class="full" />

<h2 id="bboards">Discussion Boards</h2>
  
 <p> Many Chemeketa Online courses utilize a discussion board. 
  The eLearn System (the online course interface at Chemeketa) discussion board allows
  students and instructors to &quot;post&quot; and reply to text-based messages. You can post and read messages 
  when it is convenient for you rather than at a scheduled time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The discussion board groups together messages that relate 
  to the same topic in a &quot;threaded discussion&quot;. For example, if an instructor 
  posts a question, then each student's individual reply is grouped with the original 
  note.
  </li>
  <li>Each person's response is displayed for everyone else to see. 
  Perhaps you are interested in something written by one of your classmates;  
  you can post a message in response to your classmate. Don't be surprised if you discover responses 
  to what you've written from several of your classmates!
  </li>
</ul>

<hr class="full" />

<h2 id="email">Email</h2>

  <p>Email is a great way to communicate at 
  times that are convenient both for you and the recipient. 
  You will probably use email to communicate with your 
  instructor and classmates. Email does have its limitations and it takes some savvy 
  to use it well. </p>
<h3>Some things to keep in mind about email:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Double check to whom you're sending email. It can be embarrassing when an 
    email that you meant for one person ends up being read by others.<br />
  </li>
  <li> Using all capital letters in email is equivalent to shouting.</li>
  <li>Use a meaningful subject line so your readers will 
    have a clear idea of what your message is about.</li>
  <li> Don't forward others' messages without asking first. While you should always 
    write your email messages assuming others may see them, 
    it is considered very rude to forward someone else's message without asking 
    their permission.</li>
  <li>Misunderstandings are more common with email than other communication 
    methods. </li>

</ul>
<h3>Times to use the phone instead of email: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>When security is necessary. A private conversation 
    or phone call is more secure than email, which can be distributed to many 
    people. </li>
	<li>Email is best for the dissemination of facts. When you're dealing 
    with an emotionally charged subject, you may want to use the phone instead. </li>
  <li>When it's a group discussion (or use chats, bulletin boards, or teleconferences). </li>
  <li>When you're communicating with someone who 
    doesn't read or respond to email regularly and you need an immediate response.</li>
  <li>When it's hard to discuss the topic in 
    writing without being intimidating or rude. </li>
  <li>When you have a series of questions for 
    someone that will take awhile to answer.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="full" />

<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>
<p>A chat session is like a classroom discussion because the instructor 
  and students are all participating at the same time. But unlike a classroom 
  discussion, you are all working in separate locations from your own computers.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this can sometimes be a little confusing. 
  You will need to &quot;think on your feet&quot; (or fingers) and type quickly to express 
  your thoughts as you're thinking them. Chats can also be hard to follow. Since 
  each contribution displays when its writer finishes typing, it is easy for conversations 
  to be out of order. Experienced instructors find ways to remedy this: for example, 
  your instructor might ask students to indicate when they have something to say 
  and then call on them to &quot;speak&quot; (type) so the conversation can be more easily 
  followed.</p>
<p>The advantage of chats is that they allow people in separate 
  locations to &quot;talk&quot; to one another in real time.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">-go to the top of this page-</a></p>

<hr class="full" />

<h2 id="netiquette">&quot;Netiquette&quot;</h2>

<p>  There are special rules of personal conduct that apply to all online communications. 
    Here is a sampling of some of them.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>In general, email and bulletin board messages should be short and to the 
    point (although there are exceptions to this rule, such as assignments that 
    are submitted by email or bulletin board. But generally you'll be submitting 
    assignments as file attachments). </li>
  <li>Make sure to have a meaningful subject line for your email and message board 
    contributions so others will know what to expect.</li>
  <li>Be polite and respectful. It can be tempting to let yourself go in an environment 
    that feels anonymous, but remember that there are real people reading your 
    messages. Good online manners are vital to a productive and supportive online 
    learning environment.</li>
  <li> Be tolerant of views expressed by others. Your Chemeketa online classroom may 
    well be bringing you together with people from all over the world. Keep in 
    mind that you probably have something to gain from exposure to views and backgrounds 
    different than your own.</li>
  <li>When reacting to someone else's message, address the ideas, not the person. 
    Again, remember that there are real people on the other end.</li>
  <li>Be careful when using sarcasm and humor, and don't include any obscenities 
    in your messages. Without face-to-face communications, people may take your 
    humor personally, and you never know who may be offended by expressions that 
    are commonplace to you.</li>
  <li> Don't send commercial advertisements or  &quot;chain mail&quot; to your classmates.</li>

</ul>
