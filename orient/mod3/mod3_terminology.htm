		<dt>Virtual Memory</dt><dd>A technique offered by many manufacturers which make the memory size look larger to the program than it actually is. The virtual memory operating system scans programs for code that has already been used or has low priority. It then moves these parts of the programs into a temporary storage area, unknown to the user or programmer. It does not generally affect the speed or execution it the total size of programs to be executed does not exceed available memory by more than 25% or so. Thereafter there is an increasing degradation in performance.</dd>
